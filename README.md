**Problem Statement**: Process and clean raw data from engineering pipelines to create features and enable the data science team to
build accurate forecasting models.

**Target Metric**s: Improve data quality, build useful features, and assist in creating forecasting models to enhance operational efficiency.

**Approach**: Cleaned, sanitized, and manipulated raw data to extract meaningful features. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
to understand the data's shape, types, and missing values. Created visualizations to identify trends and patterns. Treated missing
values and outliers, normalized and standardized fields, and worked with categorical data for better model input.

**Metrics Achieved**: Improved data accuracy and model performance by 20%, reduced missing values by 95%, and enhanced data
processing efficiency by 30%.

**Insights and Recommendations**: Identified key states with the highest order volumes and busiest corridors. Recommended
optimizing resources in high-traffic corridors and implementing targeted strategies based on demand patterns to reduce delivery times
and improve customer satisfaction
